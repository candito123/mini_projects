# mini_projects
This repository provides the contents (source code)of my mini projects.
The links from my website map to corresponding directories.
A name of the directory should be similar to the name of the mini project.

Note that the integration of my mini projects does not guarantee
the complete implementation of my complete proeject since they mostly are
from the project prototpye and there would have been further update for the
complete projects(but they can be good starting points).
